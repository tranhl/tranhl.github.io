**TLDR:** Hold `⌘ Cmd` (Mac) or `Ctrl` (Windows/Linux) to open the page in a new window.

When preparing the script for my upcoming Google Analytics blog post, I found myself needing to reference the research document. Naturally, I reach for the trusty tab to do the job. But wait, how do I open up a page in a new tab in Notion? I've got the script and research document organized in an inline database, so opening one would close the other.

Luckily I [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotionSo/comments/a5ampu/multiple_notion_pages_open_at_once/) that opening a page while holding down `⌘ Cmd` opens up the page in a new Notion window. Not quite a tab, but works well enough for me! For you Windows people, hold down `Ctrl` instead.

Hope that helps!
