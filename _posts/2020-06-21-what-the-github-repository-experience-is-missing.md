File browsing. It's missing file browsing — and lets be honest, the current experience hardly counts.

Browsing files on GitHub has always been a complete pain. If you're familiar with IDEs, then you'll be accustomed to freely opening and closing folders as you navigate through your project. But sadly not on GitHub.

{%
  include image.html
  url="/assets/img/feature-preview-screenshot.png"
  alt="GitHub feature preview settings"
  caption="The new 'Repository refresh' feature preview. Access it via <i>Your avatar > Feature preview</i>"
%}

The repository refresh feature preview gave me hope that there would be an improvement to the file browsing experience, but sadly it remains the same. Click on the folder you want to drill down into, and wait for the page to load. Rinse and repeat. Want to look at a different file tree? Prepare to navigate back a couple of times. If you're smart you'll open the folders in separate tabs, that way you can just close the tab. But what if the folder you want to open isn't on the same hierarchical level? Not much luck there, a few more page loads for you.

Thankfully there are a couple of browser extensions available that directly address this issue:

- [Tako](https://github.com/brumm/tako) (Chrome, Firefox).
- [Octotree](https://github.com/ovity/octotree) (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari).
- [Gitako](https://github.com/EnixCoda/Gitako) (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

I personally prefer Tako. It replaces the traditional file browser with an IDE-like interface. I wasn't a fan of the sidebar approach that the other options provided, but comes down to personal preference at the end of the day.

I'd be interested to know the reasons why the file browsing experience isn't better though — everything in software is intentional after all.
